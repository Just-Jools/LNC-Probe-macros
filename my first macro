//Macro that just starts where-ever spindle is, goes down touches off and records the z height into the current coordinate system.//

//assumes probe T30 is in spindle//


G54         //select coordinate system to use//
G91 // turn on incremental movement
G43 H30 //use tool offset 30 which is my probe
G09 G31P2 Z-10 F1500 //Seek move moving ten mm down. come to stop on signal
if R_SKIP[0,1] = 1  //if probe triggered.
    Z3              // retract 3 upwards
G09 G31P2 Z-4 F50  Do a slow probe
G90  // turn absulute mode on
G00 Z0  //rapid probe up and out of the way

// Need the code to add the probed Z coordinate to the current offset table//





//R_SKIP[0,102]       //this is where the Z skip coordinates are stored.
    
    
  Is this fairly basic but corect?
