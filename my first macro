//Macro that just starts where-ever spindle is, goes down touches off and records the z height into the current coordinate system.//

//assumes probe T30 is in spindle//

M06 T30			//Tool change to probe incase it's not in the spindle

G91 			// turn on incremental movement
G43 H30 		//use tool offset 30 which is my probe
G09 G31P2 Z-10 F1500 	//Seek move moving ten mm down. come to stop on signal
G01 Z3 F100             // retract 3 upwards
G09 G31P2 Z-4 F100  	//Do a slow probe
G04 X2			//Wait a bit 			
G00 G53 Z0  		//rapid probe up and out of the way using machine coordinates

G10 





//R_SKIP[0,102]       //this is where the Z skip coordinates are stored.
    
    
  Is this fairly basic but corect?
